# language-translator
This is the language translator tool where the user can convert the text into target language .
This Python code is a simple application built using Tkinter, a GUI toolkit, for translating conversations between two languages. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

GUI Setup: The code sets up a Tkinter window titled "Conversation Translator" with various widgets like labels, text fields, buttons, and a scrollbar.

Translation Logic: It utilizes Google Translate API through the googletrans library to translate text from one language to another.

Speech Recognition: It employs the speech_recognition library to recognize speech input from the user's microphone.

Text-to-Speech: It uses the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert translated text into speech and plays it back.

Geolocation: It fetches the user's current geolocation using the geocoder library based on their IP address and then reverse geocodes the latitude and longitude coordinates to obtain the corresponding address using the geopy library.

Console Redirection: The ConsoleRedirector class redirects standard output (print statements) to a text widget in the GUI to display messages and debugging information.

Main Functionality: The main functionality includes:

Speech to text conversion
Text translation
Text-to-speech conversion
Clearing text fields
Retrieving and displaying geolocation information
Error Handling: It incorporates basic error handling for cases such as unrecognized speech input and errors in fetching location information.
